# iSphere

Unit Testing for RPG Developers on IBM i.

## Description

iSphere is an open source plug-in for IBM's Rational Developer for i 9.5.1.3+. It delivers high quality extensions to improve developer productivity.

IBM's current Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a huge step beyond SEU, but it still lacks features available only on the green screen. That is where the iSphere Project comes into play, filling in those gaps.

Further information about iSphere are available on the [iSphere Web Site](https://ibm-i-isphere.github.io/isphere/).

Please refer to the [iSphere Version History](<https://ibm-i-isphere.github.io/isphere/files/iSphere for RDi 9.5.1.3+.pdf>) document to find out which operating system release is required for installing the iSphere library.
