	<p>
	<h2>Ignore Source Member Date Column</h2>
	<p>
	This extension is included in the <i>iSphere Compare Filters</i> plug-in. It fixes the problem
	that the date of all source line dates were set to the current date when a source member is saved 
	from the <i>iSphere Compare/Merge</i> editor and with option <i>Don't consider date</i>. 
	<p>
	Starting with RDi 9.5 (Eclipse 4.4) iSphere uses a compare filter to ignore the date column to
	preserve the date of the source lines.
	<p>
	The <i>Don't consider date (ignore date)</i> option is also available from the context menu of the 
	compare editor:

	You need to select "Help > Install New Software..." to install the compare filter extension, because
	"Help > Check for Updates" does not install new features. It only updates already installed features.
