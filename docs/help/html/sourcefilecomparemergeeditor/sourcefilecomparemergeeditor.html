	<h1>Source File Compare/Merge Editor</h1>
	<p>The Compare/Merge Editor allows you to compare and merge source
		physical file members. The results of the compare are shown in left
		and right panes and you can easily copy some or all of the differences
		from the right pane to the left pane.

	<h2>Comparing Remote Members</h2>
	<p>To compare/merge source physical file members:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu (right
			click) of a source physical file member. This is the source file that
			will be opened in the left pane.</li>
		<li>Select menu item "iSphere Source Member Compare Editor".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<table border="0">
		<tr>

		<td valign="top">
            <P>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>Set the Mode for the compare:
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li>Use "Open for browse" or "Open for edit" to specify how the
					left pane of the compare opens.</li>
				<li>Use "Don't consider date" or "Consider date" to specify if
					the date field in each source line will be used in the compare.</li>
				<li>Use "Don't ignore case" of "Ignore case" to specify if the
					compare should be case sensitive of insensitive.</li>
				<li>Use "Two way compare" to compare two source members.</li>
				<li>Use "Three way compare" to include an ancestor to the source
					in the right pane.<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>Note that in the &quot;Left&quot; section the name of the
				source member for the left pane is specified and cannot be changed.</p>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>
				In the "Right" section the Library, File and Member have been
				defaulted to the &quot;Left&quot; values. <br>Change as needed
				to specify the source member that is to be compared to the source
				member in the "Left" section.
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			Click the [OK] button to start the compare.

	<h2>Selecting Multiple Members at Once</h2>
	<p>
	<h3>Two Members</h3>
	<p>
		If two members are selected at once, the first member is the <i>Left
			member</i> and the second one is the <i>Right member</i>. <p>The members can
		be switched with the switch member button located between the &quot;Left&quot;
		and &quot;Right&quot; member sections:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/switch_members_button.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<h3>Three or More Members</h3>
	<p>This is a special case where you want to compare members of the
		same name in different library or source file. For example, comparing
		members at the development level with those in production. You have to
		enter the specifications in the right pane only once.
	<P>Consider this example where we want to compare three members in
		a development library with the same three members in the production
		library.
	<p>We have highlighted the three members in the RSE view, right
		clicked, and clicked "iSphere Source Member Compare Editor".
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/three_or_more_members.png" align="middle"
			style="float: none">
	<p>
		In the "Left" section the member is set to <i>*SELECTED</i> and cannot
		be changed. This means that it will be replaced successively by the
		member names that have been selected in the RSE view, and each will be compared
		to the same member in the "Right" section.
	<p>
		In the "Right" section the Connection, Library or File may be changed,
		but the name of the right member is set to <i>*LEFT</i> and cannot be
		changed.
	<p>To compare to the production library, we set the &quot;File&quot;
		field to ISP_PROD and click [OK]. A compare is run for each selected
		member and a tab opens for each member where there are differences.  In this example, there are changes only  in DEMO1 and DEMO3 so there are two compare tabs.  There are no changes in DEMO2.

	<h2>Starting The Compare Editor From an Lpex Editor</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be started from the context menu of a Lpex 
	   editor. Select <i>Source -> Compare...</i> to do so. Please notice that:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no edit option when the compare editor is started from an Lpex editor.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<a id="#starting_the_compare_editor_from_the_isphere_menu" />
	<h2>Starting The Compare Editor From the iSphere menu</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be started from the iSphere menu of the main menu 
	   bar. Select <i>iSphere -> Compare Source Members</i> to do so.
	<p>
	<a id="#comparing_i_project_members" />
	<h2>Comparing i Project Members</h2>
	<p>When the iSphere compare editor is started from an Lpex editor with a source member loaded
	   from an i Project, then the following additional rules are enforced:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no edit option for i Project members.</li>
	<li>When the i Project member does not have sequence numbers and date fields, the <i>Consider date</i> option 
	    is not available and sequence numbers and last changed dates are not displayed at all.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<a id="#loading_previous_values" />
	<h2>Loading Previous Values</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be configured to load the values of the right and/or ancestor 
	   member of the previous compare action. The associated options can be configured on the
	   <a href="preferences/preferences.html"><i>preferences</i></a> page.
	   The rules for loading previous values are: 
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Previous values for left, right and ancestor member are always loaded, when the compare editor
	    is started from the iSphere menu.</li>
    <li>The previously used values of the right member are loaded when the associated option 
        has been selected on the preference page.</li>
    <li>The previously used values of the ancestor member are loaded when the associated option 
        has been selected on the preference page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The history values of libraries, files and members are always updated. The history values are the 
	values that you can select from the combo box. These values can be edited with the little button 
	at the right hand side of the combo box.
	<p>
	The previously used values are the connection, library, file and member names of the last compare
	operation.
	<p>
	Both types of values are stored as independent value sets depending on the number of members selected for a 
	compare operation. For example, when you star the compare editor from the iSphere menu, there are no members 
	selected. But when you right-click a member to start a compare operation, then there is one selected member.
