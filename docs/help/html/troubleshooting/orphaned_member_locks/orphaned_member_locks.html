	<h1>Orphaned Member Locks</h1>
	<p>
	Sometimes it happens, that source members are locked when you try to
	open the LPEX editor or the <i>Source File Compare/Merge Editor</i>.
	<p>
	For the compare editor, the problem can be reproduced by following
	these steps:
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Open the compare editor, eg. for members DEMO1 (left) and DEMO2.</li>
	<li>Drop the connection to the IBM i by shutting down the VPN client.</li>
	<li>Reconnected the VPN client.</li>
	<li>Closed the compare editor.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Now, when the compare editor is closed, iSphere attempts to close the
	left-side member. Since that fails with an exception, iSphere appends
	the following message to the Eclipse error log:
	<p>

	<p>
	The only way to clear the error is to end the job on the IBM i server
	by hand.
