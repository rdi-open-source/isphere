	<h1>Synchronize Members Editor</h1>
	<a href="https://github.com/rdi-open-source/isphere/" target="_blank">

	</a> The Synchronize Members Editor lets you compare, edit and synchronize the
	source members of two source files or all source files of two libraries. The comparison
	clearly highlights the differences. Here is a sample comparison:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/synchronize_members_editor.png" align="middle">

    <p>
    The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> compares the date and time the content
    of the source members has been last changed. This information is displayed in
    SEU with option 8 next to the member in fields "Change date" and "Change time" .
    <p>
    The content of the source members is not compared line by line, but by a CRC32
    checksum that is calculated on the host system.
    <p>
    <i>Synchronizing on the Same System</i>
    <p>
    The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> uses the <i>CPYF</i>
    command for copying source members. Because of the nature of the <i>CPYF</i>
    command, the last changed date and time of the source members are identical
    after the synchronization.
    <p>
    <i>Synchronizing on Different Systems</i>
    <p>
    The <i>Synchronize Members Editor</i> downloads the source member to the
    local computer and uploads it to the remote system. Obviously the last
    changed date and time of the source members do not match after the
    synchronization.

    <h2>Starting the Editor</h2>
    <p>
    The Synchronize Members Editor is started from an object or library filter in the
    Remote Systems view. Usually one would select two objects of the same kind. But it
    is also possible to open the editor with one selected object. In that case the
    second object must be added after the editor has been opened.
    <p>
    The possible object types are:
    <ul>
    <li>source file</li>
    <li>library</li>
    </ul>

	<h2>Comparing Source Members</h2>
	<p>
		Select one, preferably two, source files or libraries from the RSE tree and from
		the context menu (right click) select <i>iSphere Synchronize Members</i>r. If
		you select only one source file or library, then you need to
		open the second file or library from the compare editor.

    <h3>Ignoring Last Changed Date</h3>
	<p>The &quot;Ignore date&quot; checkbox specifies whether or not the last changed
	   Date and time of the source members is taken into account. If the &quot;Ignore
	   date&quot; checkbox is selected, the last changed date and time is ignored.

    <h3>Selecting Members by Name and Type</h3>
    <p>Source members can be selected by name and type. Enter the selection mask into
       the &quot;Filter&quot; field before starting the comparison:
    <p>
        <img src="assets/filter_mask.png" align="middle">
    <p>With that filter in place, you will get all &quot;CLLE&quot; source members
       starting with &quot;BUILD_&quot;:
    <p>
        <img src="assets/synchronize_members_editor_selected.png" align="middle">
    <p>You can add multiple patterns separated by a space, comma or semicolon, for
    example: 
    <pre class="codeIndent">
    <b>*.rpgle, *.clle</b>.
    </pre>
    <p>In case you want to exclude members by name and/or type, you can negate
       the selection mask by a preceding &quot;|&quot; (pipe symbol):
    <p>
        <img src="assets/filter_mask_negated.png" align="middle">
    <p>All patterns following the pipe symbol are considered negated, for example:
    <pre class="codeIndent">
    <b>*.rpgle, |demo*.*</b>.
    </pre>
    <p>It is also possible to use regular expressions for filtering items by name
    and type. Regular expressions must be start with a "<" character. The following
    example selects all members starting with "DEMO" followed by up to 6 unspecified
    characters. The member type must be "DSPF" or "PRTF":
    <pre class="codeIndent">
    <b>&lt;DEMO.{1,6}\.(PRT|DSP)F</b>
    </pre>
    <p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="notice">Entering a search string or a regular expression in
            upper or lower case does not matter, because the case is ignored.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Starting Comparison</h3>
    <p>Once there is a source file or library in both sides and after having set
       all necessary option, click [Compare] to start a comparison.
    <p>After the compare process finishes, note that icons between the
        two panes clearly display the differences.

    <h2>Synchronizing Members</h2>
    Members selected to be synchronized are indicated by a right green
    arrow and a left blue arrow between the panes. A member that does not
    have an arrow will not be changed by the [Synchronize] button.

	<h3>Filtering Source Members</h3>
	<p>Use the filter buttons in the &quot;Display&quot; section to
		filter the source members after the comparison:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/filter_options.png" align="middle">
	<p>A checked button indicates that the relevant entries are
		displayed. Uncheck one or more buttons to remove entries from the
		display. For example, unchecking [=] will remove from the display all
		source members that are identical in both source files.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/synchronize_members_editor_filtered.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>The status bar provides information on filtered entries. In the
		two libraries compared above, &quot;Items found: 8/15&quot; means that
		8 out of 15 members are displayed. Then information about the possible
		compare status follows. So there are 0 out of 7 identical members
		and a total of 4 different members displayed. Last but not least there
		are 3 unique members at the left and 1 unique member at the right without
		a counterpart on the other side.

    <h3>Modify Synchronization Action</h3>
	<p>Use the context (right click) menu on members to set the left
		or right arrows in the direction you want synchronization to occur.
	<p>The complete context menu looks like this:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/context_menu.png" align="middle">
	<p>For example you may want to change the &quot;not equal&quot;
		action using &quot;Select for copying &lt;- (right to left)&quot; or
		using &quot;Select for copying -&gt; (left to right)&quot;. You may
		want to use &quot;Remove selection&quot; on members which are missing
		from one of the source files to avoid copying them to the other
		source file.
	<p>Note that you can also conveniently delete, edit and compare
		source members using the context menu.

    <h3>Set Existing Members Action</h3>
	<p>Use the &quot;Existing members action&quot; options to specify what to do
		if a source members exists. Option &quot;Error&quot; means, that the member
		is not copied and marked as &quot;in error state&quot;. &quot;Replace&quot;
		means, that existing members are replaced silently.
    <p>
        <img src="assets/member_with_error.png" align="middle">

    <h3>Starting Synchronization</h3>
	<p>When you are satisfied that you have all the left and right arrows set
		correctly, click [Synchronize] to make the changes. <b>Note:</b> There
		is no &quot;Undo&quot; after you click [Synchronize].
	<p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Note the &quot;Auto-Compare&quot; checkbox.
				If checked, the source files will be compared automatically after
				the files are synchronized. If not checked, changed table items
				which  no longer match the filter options are not immediately
				removed from the table. The items are kept in the table to give you
				a chance to change them again, without changing the filter options.
				The status bar always show the correct values according to the
				filter options. You can toggle a filter option of your choice to
				update the table view.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
    <p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="notice">Note the &quot;Display errors only&quot; checkbox.
                If checked, only the members that are in error state are displayed. That
                is helpful for identifying members that have not been synchronized due to
                errors.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Checking Synchronization Errors</h2>
    Members with errors are marked with a red stop sign. The error is displayed in the
    status line and in the properties view if the member is selected.
    <p>Status line:
    <p>
        <img src="assets/status_line_error.png" align="middle">
    <p>Properties view:
    <p>
        <img src="assets/properties_view.png" align="middle">
        
    <p>Use option &quot;Display errors only&quot; to filter the member list for
       items in error status.
	<p>
	<h2>Comparing Source Members Side by Side</h2>
		<p>There are three ways to find differences by opening the compare
			dialog:
		<ul>
			<li>Double click a source member</li>
			<li>Select a source member and use the <i>Enter</i> key
			</li>
			<li>Right click, then click &quot;Compare left & right&quot; from the
				context menu</li>
		</ul>
