	<h1>Data Spaces</h1>
	In iSphere,
	<i>Data Spaces</i> is a term that is used to refer to both
	<u>data</u> areas and user
	<u>spaces</u>.
	<p>
		From a programmer's point of view, both objects are similar;
		essentially each is an undefined string of bytes. Programmatically, they are accessed
		differently, but in iSphere they can be maintained in a similar
		fashion. Thus it is easier to just refer to them as <i>data spaces</i>
		instead of constantly having to say "<i>data areas and user spaces</i>".
	<p>With iSphere Data Space support you can add structure to the
		string of bytes in a data space (a data area or a user space).
