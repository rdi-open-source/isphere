	<h1>Source File Search</h1>
	<a href="https://github.com/rdi-open-source/isphere/" target="_blank">

	</a> The Source File Search feature provides an extremely fast search of
	source on the server. Searching a member filter in the Remote Systems
	Explorer with iSphere Source File Search is about 60 times faster than
	searching with the original RSE Search. The first time after an IPL,
	iSphere Source File Search may take a little longer, but you should see
	the improvement in subsequent runs.
	<p>To search source files on a server:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu (right
			click) for a library filter, a member filter or a source physical
			file member.</li>
		<li>Select menu item "iSphere Source File Search".</li>
		<li>Enter the search string.<br>Use the drop down to the
			left to select either &quot;contains&quot; or &quot;contains
			not&quot;.<br>Check &quot;Case sensitive&quot; if you want the
			search to be case sensitive.<br>Check &quot;<a href="../search/regularexpressions/regularexpressions.html">Regular expression</a>&quot; if 
			you want to use a <a href="../search/regularexpressions/regularexpressions.html">regular expression</a> expression as the search argument.<br>
			Click [+] to add additional
			search strings. (Search strings have an &quot;and&quot; or
			&quot;or&quot; relationship, depending on whether &quot;Match all of
			the following&quot; or &quot;Match any of the following&quot; is
			selected.) <br>Click [-] to remove a search string.<br>
			Click "OK".
		</li>
	</ul>
    Limits:
    <ul>
        <li>Search argument length: 228</li>
        <li>Regular expression length: 256</li>
        <li>Source file record length: 240</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
