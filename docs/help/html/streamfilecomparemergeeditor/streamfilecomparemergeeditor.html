	<h1>Stream File Compare/Merge Editor</h1>
	<p>The Compare/Merge Editor allows you to compare and merge source
		stream files. The results of the compare are shown in left
		and right panes and you can easily copy some or all of the differences
		from the right pane to the left pane.

	<h2>Comparing Remote Stream Files</h2>
	<p>To compare/merge source stream files:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu (right
			click) of a source stream file. This is the source file that
			will be opened in the left pane.</li>
		<li>Select menu item "iSphere Stream File Compare Editor".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<table border="0">
        <tr>
		  <td valign="top"><img src="assets/compare_merge_select.png" align="middle" style="float: left; margin-right: 5em";></td>
		<td valign="top">
			<p>Set the Mode for the compare:
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li>Use "Open for browse" or "Open for edit" to specify how the
					left pane of the compare opens.</li>
				<li>Use "Don't ignore case" of "Ignore case" to specify if the
					compare should be case sensitive of insensitive.</li>
				<li>Use "Two way compare" to compare two source stream files.</li>
				<li>Use "Three way compare" to include an ancestor to the source
					in the right pane.<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>Note that in the &quot;Left&quot; section the name of the
				source stream file for the left pane is specified and cannot be changed.</p>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>
				In the "Right" section the Directory and Stream file have been
				defaulted to the &quot;Left&quot; values. <br>Change as needed
				to specify the source stream file that is to be compared to the source
				stream file in the "Left" section.
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			Click the [OK] button to start the compare.

	<h2>Selecting Multiple Stream Files at Once</h2>
	<p>
	<h3>Two Stream Files</h3>
	<p>
		If two stream files are selected at once, the first stream file is the <i>Left
		stream file</i> and the second one is the <i>Right stream file</i>. <p>The stream files
		can be switched with the switch stream file button located between the &quot;Left&quot;
		and &quot;Right&quot; stream file sections:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/switch_stream_files_button.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<h3>Three or More Stream Files</h3>
	<p>This is a special case where you want to compare stream files of the
		same name in different directories. For example, comparing stream
		files at the development level with those in production. You have to
		enter the specifications in the right pane only once.
	<P>Consider this example where we want to compare three stream files in
		a development directory with the same three stream files in the production
		directory.
	<p>We have highlighted the three stream files in the RSE view, right
		clicked, and clicked "iSphere Stream File Compare Editor".
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/three_or_more_stream_files.png" align="middle"
			style="float: none">
	<p>
		In the "Left" section the stream file is set to <i>*SELECTED</i> and cannot
		be changed. This means that it will be replaced successively by the
		stream file names that have been selected in the RSE view, and each will be compared
		to the same stream file in the "Right" section.
	<p>
		In the "Right" section the Connection or Directory may be changed,
		but the name of the right stream file is set to <i>*LEFT</i> and cannot be
		changed.
	<p>To compare to the production directory, we set the &quot;Directory&quot;
		field to "../ISPHEREPRD/.." and click [OK]. A compare is run for each selected
		stream file and a tab opens for each stream file where there are differences. In this
		example, there are changes only  in DEMO1 and DEMO3 so there are two compare tabs.
		There are no changes in DEMO2.

	<h2>Starting The Compare Editor From an Lpex Editor</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be started from the context menu of a Lpex 
	   editor. Select <i>Source -> Compare...</i> to do so. Please notice that:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no edit option when the compare editor is started from an Lpex editor.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<a id="#starting_the_compare_editor_from_the_isphere_menu" />
	<h2>Starting The Compare Editor From the iSphere menu</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be started from the iSphere menu of the main menu 
	   bar. Select <i>iSphere -> Compare Stream Files</i> to do so.
	<p>
	<a id="#loading_previous_values" />
	<h2>Loading Previous Values</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be configured to load the values of the right and/or ancestor 
	   stream file of the previous compare action. The associated options can be configured on the
	   <a href="preferences/preferences.html"><i>preferences</i></a> page.
	   The rules for loading previous values are: 
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Previous values for left, right and ancestor stream files are always loaded, when the compare
	    editor is started from the iSphere menu.</li>
    <li>The previously used values of the right stream file are loaded when the associated option 
        has been selected on the preference page.</li>
    <li>The previously used values of the ancestor stream file are loaded when the associated option 
        has been selected on the preference page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The history values of directories and stream files are always updated. The history values are the 
	values that you can select from the combo box. These values can be edited with the little button 
	at the right hand side of the combo box.
	<p>
	The previously used values are the connection, directory and stream file names of the last compare
	operation.
	<p>
	Both types of values are stored as independent value sets depending on the number of stream files selected for a 
	compare operation. For example, when you star the compare editor from the iSphere menu, there are no stream files 
	selected. But when you right-click a stream file to start a compare operation, then there is one selected stream file.
