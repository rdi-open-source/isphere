<h1>iSphere API</h1>
<p>
Starting with version 4, iSphere provides an API for enabling other Eclipse 
based applications to call and use iSphere functions.
<p>
Each iSphere plug-in has its own API, whose class is always called: <i>Access</i>.
<p>
The API is not yet complete, but is supposed to grow over the time.
