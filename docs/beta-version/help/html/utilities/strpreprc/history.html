<h1>History of STRPREPRC</h1>
<p>
The STRPREPRC utility has been born when we started using a Software Change Management System (CMS). The
CMS of our choice came we a list of default object creation command for each object type to compile the
objects. Of course that list could be tweaked to match our needs.
<p>
The problem was to specify object specific parameters, which is often necessary for printer or display 
files. Those parameters were stored in a database under the cover and not visible to the developer who
had to maintain an object.
<p>
That was the point when STRPREPRC was born. That also explains the somewhat strange parameters of the 
utility, for example &TYPECODE or &U0-&U1.
