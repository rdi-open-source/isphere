<h1>Start Pre-Processor (STRPREPRC)</h1>
<p>
The <i>Start Pre-Processor</i> is used to retrieve the compile command and the compile parameters
from the source member and compile the object afterwards. This way, object specific compile parameters 
can be stored in the source member without any risk of getting lost. 
<p>
The iSphere project team uses the STRPREPRC utility to compile all objects of the iSphere library.
<p>
Another advantage of the utility is that you do not need to use different object creation commands,
but STRPREPRC for all object types.
<p>
Furthermore you can use it for creating non-source objects from source. The iSphere data area 
<i>ISPHERE</i>, which contains version information, is a good and elaborated example for that. All 
you need for simple objects is a source member with the STRPREPRC section with the CL command for 
creating the object. But for the iSphere data area we do it slightly different, because we want to 
initialize the data area with certain values. For that purpose we compile a CL program into QTEMP 
and afterwards execute it to create and initialize the data area.

<p>
The STRPREPRC utility is shipped with the iSphere library and it is up to you to take advantage from 
it. A good starting point is the following 'general purposes' command: 
<p>
<div class="codeCommand">STRPREPRC USESRCFILE(&L/&F) USESRCMBR(&N) OPTION(*EVENTF) CHGOBJD(*NO) LIB(&O) OBJ(&N) SRCLIB(&L) SRCFILE(&F) SRCMBR(&N) USER0(&X)</div> 
<p>
Open the <i>i Projects</i> perspective and select the <i>Work With Compile Commands...</i> option from 
the context menu of your i Project or a source member.

<p>
Then add the <i>STRPREPRC</i> command to the source member types that you want to use the STRPREPRC 
utility for:
