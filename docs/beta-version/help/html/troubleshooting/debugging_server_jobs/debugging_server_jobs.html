	<h1>Debugging Server Jobs</h1>
	<p>
	Sometimes it can be necessary to check the job logs of the RDi server jobs in order
	to find the answer for an existing problem. In this case there are two options:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="#jobs_subsystem">RDi <i>Jobs</i> subsystem and iSphere Job Log Explorer</a></li>
	<li><a href="#netstat">Command NETSTAT on a 5250 session</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<a id="#jobs_subsystem"></a>
	<h2>Jobs Subsystem</h2>
	<p>
	Expand the <i>Jobs</i> subsystem and the <i>My active jobs</i> node:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_my_active_jobs.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	The relevant jobs are listed below the <i>QSERVER</i> and <i>QSYSWRK</i> nodes. Use the 
	<a href="/help/topic/biz.isphere.joblogexplorer.help/html/joblogexplorer/joblogexplorer.html">iSphere Job Log Explorer</a> to search the job logs for messages that could explain the problem.
	<p>
	<table>
	<tr><td valign="top">QPWFSERVSO</td><td width="10px"></td>
	                               <td>This  program belongs to the <i>*FILE</i> server that is started with STRHOSTSVR 
	                                   SERVER(*FILE). The job is started when RDi establishs a connection to a host. Usually
	                                   that job is not relevant for analyzing iSphere problems.</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top">QZRCSRVS  </td><td width="10px"></td>
	                               <td>This  program belongs to the <i>*RMTCMD</i> server that is started with STRHOSTSVR 
	                                   SERVER(*RMTCMD). The job is started when RDi establishs a connection to a host. Whenever
	                                   iSphere executes a CL command or calls a program, this job is used. Look at this job
	                                   when trying to solve a problem.</td></tr>
	<tr><td valign="top">QZDASOINIT</td><td width="10px"></td>
	                               <td>This  program belongs to the <i>*DATABASE</i> server that is started with STRHOSTSVR 
	                                   SERVER(*DATABASE). The job is started when RDi or iSphere executes a JDBC statement. Look 
	                                   at this job when trying to solve a problem.</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	<a id="#netstat"></a>
	<h2>NETSTAT Command</h2>
	<p>
	You need to know the TCP/IP address of your PC client, when you want to use the NETSTAT command. Without
	that address it can be very difficult to find the relevant jobs. You can use the Retrieve Device Description (QDCRDEVD) API,
	format DEVD0600 to retrieve the TCP/IP address in dotted decimal form. Or you can use 
	the <a href="/help/topic/biz.isphere.base.help/html/utilities/whoami/whoami.html">WHOAMI</a> command
	that is shipped with iSphere and which is available as an XML installation package in file QBUILD in
	the iSphere product library. 
	<p>
	Now, figure out your TCP/IP address. Then execute the NETSTAT command and use option 3 to 
	work with the IPv4 connection status. Use F15 to create a subset with the connections 
	of your TCP/IP address.
	<p>

	<p>
	The result is a nice and short list with your jobs:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/netstat_my_jobs.png" align="middle" >
	<p>
	Use option 8 to display the jobs of a given connection and then proceed with option 5 to
	work with a job. From there option 10 takes you to the job log.
