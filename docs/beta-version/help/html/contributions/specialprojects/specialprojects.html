<h1>iSphere Special Projects</h1>
<p>
There are some projects that are not intuitively to understand and that may need some additional explanation.
<p>
<h2>iSphere Compare Filters Compile-Dummy (RDi)</h2>
<p>
This project is a dummy project that is required to compile the <i>iSphere Compare Filters Plugin (RDi)</i> from RDi 8.0. It
provides the <i>org.eclipse.compare.ICompareFilter</i> interface and the <i>org.eclipse.compare.compareFilters</i> extension
point, which have been added with RDi 9.5 (Eclipse 4.4) and that are not available in RDi 8.0.
<p>
<h2>iSphere Security Plugin (WDSCi)</h2>
<p>
This plug-in emulates the Eclipse secure storage, which is not available for WDSCi 7.0.
