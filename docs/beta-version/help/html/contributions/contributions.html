	<h1>Contributions to the iSphere Project</h1>
	<p>
		We are open to developers who want to contribute their ideas and
		manpower to the iSphere project. If you are good in RPG <b>and</b> you
		know how to write Eclipse plug-ins, you are invited to join the
		iSphere project team.
	<p>We regret that we do not have the time teach you how to write
		Eclipse plug-ins. Our daily work (we have to earn a living), our
		families, and the iSphere project fill up all the available time. We
		hope you understand.
	<p>If you want to join us, please drop us an email and tell us
		about your ideas and experience.
