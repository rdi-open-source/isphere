<h1>Numerical Extended Rule</h1>
The <i>Numerical Extended</i> renaming rule produces backup member names by adding a sequence number
optionally separated by a delimiter character. The new name is reduced to the specified number of
characters.
<p>
<img src="./assets/rule_numerical_extended_configuration.png" 
     align="middle">
<p>
The available options are:
<p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>Delimiter</td>
		<td valign="top">-</td>
		<td valign="top">Delimiter that separates the member name from the sequence number.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>Minimum value</td>
		<td valign="top">-</td>
		<td valign="top">Specifies the starting value of the sequence number.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>Maximum value</td>
		<td valign="top">-</td>
		<td valign="top">Specifies the maximum value of the sequence number. Renaming a member
		                 fails when the maximum sequence number has been reached.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>Minimum length</td>
		<td valign="top">-</td>
		<td valign="top">Minimum number of characters to be taken from the original name,
		                 if the new name exceeds a length of 10 characters.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top" nowrap>Is varying length</td>
		<td valign="top">-</td>
		<td valign="top">Indicates whether the old name can be shortened in order to produce
		                 a new name up to 10 characters.<br>
		                 If this property is set to <i>false</i>, then the new name is
		                 produced by the specified number of characters of the original name
		                 followed by the delimiter and a sequence number. Otherwise the new
		                 name is made of the maximum possible number of characters of the
		                 original name followed by the delimiter and a sequence number.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
Sequence numbers are generated as fixed-length numbers, such as <i>.01</i>, <i>.02</i>, <i>.03</i>
to <i>.99</i>. For example:
<p>
<table>
	<tr><td>Original name</td><td>-</td><td>DEMO1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>First backup</td><td>-</td><td>DEMO1.01</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Second backup</td><td>-</td><td>DEMO1.02</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Third backup</td><td>-</td><td>DEMO1.03</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Gaps in the list of existing backup members are not filled but skipped. For example consider the following situation:
<p>
<table>
	<tr><td>DEMO1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO1.01</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO1.02</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO1.03</td></tr>
	<tr><td style="color:red;">DEMO1.04 (missing)</td></tr>
	<tr><td style="color:red;">DEMO1.05 (missing)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO1.06</td></tr>
	<tr><td style="color:green;">DEMO1.07 (next backup member name)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In the example above, the next backup member name will be <b>DEMO1.07</b>, because the gaps of
<i>DEMO1.04</i> and <i>DEMO1.05</i> are skipped.
<p>
In case of the new name exceeds 10 characters, the rule attempts to reduce the number of characters taken from
the original name to produce a new name with a length of 10 characters.
<p>
<h2>Example 1 (default values)</h2>
<p>
In this example <i>Minimum length</i> has a value of 4 and the <i>Is varying length</i> property is set to <i>true</i>. Therefore, the new name
will always start with the maximum possible number of characters of the original name, followed by the delimiter and a sequence number.

	<tr><td>DEMO012</td></tr>

As a result, the existing members will be renamed to:

	<tr><td>DEMO012.01</td><td>(was DEMO012)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO012.02</td><td>(was DEMO0123)</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEMO012.03</td><td>(was DEMO01234)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>
In this example <i>Minimum length</i> has a value of 4 and the <i>Is varying length</i> property is set to <i>false</i>. Therefore, the new name
will always start with the first 4 characters of the original name, followed by the delimiter and a sequence number.

	<tr><td>DEMO.02</td><td>(was DEMO01234, shortened, because was &gt; 10)</td></tr>

<p>
<h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>
In this example <i>Minimum length</i> has a value of zero and the <i>Is varying length</i> property is set to <i>false</i>. The <i>delimiter</i>
is specified as <i>BAK</i>. This is a very special case, where the new name is composed by <i>BAK</i> followed by a sequence number.
