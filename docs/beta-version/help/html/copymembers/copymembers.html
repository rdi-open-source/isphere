	The <i>Copy Members</i> option lets you select and copy members from the RSE
	tree, much like the same as with PDM. You can select it from the context menu of
	the following items:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Source Member</li>
		<li>Source File</li>
		<li>Source Member Filter</li>
	</ul>
	<p>

	<p>
	The following dialog displays the items that are copied. Use the [Enter] key or command key F2 
	to edit the name of the target members. You may also click on the member name to open the field.
	Once a field is in edit mode, you can use the tab key to move forth and back between the member
	names.

	The result of the copy operation is displayed in column <i>Result</i>.

	The copy members process uses the <i>Remote Systems - File Cache</i> to get the <i>From Member</i>
	from the cache before downloading it from the remote system. That works the same as dragging and
	dropping members, which is an IBM supplied process. 
	<p>
	The problem is, that the Lpex editor also uses the local cache and in ceratin cases it can happen,
	that you change a remote member while editing it in RDi.
	<p>
	Usually that does not happen, because the remote member is locked. But when you close RDi without
	closing the member, the member is not locked again when starting RDi (next morning). That is the
	point when a member can be change locally <u>and</u> remotely. Drag & Drop just copies the member
	and hence updates the cache with the remote changes while the member is open for editing in the
	Lpex editor.
	<p>
	<u>Assume the following situation:</u> 
	<p>
	You closed RDi last evening and restart editing a member next morning. Keep in mind, that the
	member is not locked on the remote system, now. Unfortunately Mary changed the member on the
	IBM i without telling you about it: 
	<p>
	<img src="assets/mary_changes.png">
	<p>
	Your changes:
	<p>
	<img src="assets/joe_changes.png">
	<p>
	Now you want to save the old member before saving your changes and you want to drag & drop
	the old member to a save place. Doing that works fine but of course you:
	<ul>
	<li>Copied Mary's changes</li>
	<li>The local cache on your PC is refreshed with Mary's changes</li>
	</ul>
	When you attempt to save your member, the following dialog pops up:
	<p>
	<img src="assets/file_changed_warning.png">
	<p>
	Now carefully think about how to answer that question:
	<ul>
	<li>Replace contents of editor with the remote member. - Replaces your changes and your work is lost!</li>
	<li>Overwrite the remote member. - Keeps your changes but overwrites Mary's changes when the file is saved!</li>
	<li>Save the contents of the editor to a different remote member. - Most save option.</li>
	</ul>
	The first two options are dangerous!
	<p>
	In order to avoid that situation, iSphere disallows copying members that are being edited
	and that have unsaved changes:
