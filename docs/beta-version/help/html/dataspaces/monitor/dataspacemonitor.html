	</a> The
	<i>Data Space Monitor</i> is used for monitoring changes to your data
	space objects.
	<p>
		Before you can use the monitor for character data areas with mixed
		data, or for user spaces, you need to go to the <a
			href="../designer/dataspaceeditordesigner.html"><i>Data Space
				Editor Designer</i></a> and create an editor for it. For simple character
		data areas, or for decimal or logical data areas, an editor is not
		required, because the monitor can generate one for you. But it cannot
		know anything about layout of a user space, or a data area with mixed
		data, so you need to create an editor.
	<p>Once you have one or more editors for your data space object,
		you can start the monitor from the context menu (right click) in the
		RSE tree. If you have more than one editor for the selected object,
		choose the appropriate one in the popup dialog for the data you wish
		to monitor:
	<p>

	<p>This opens the monitor and the content of your data space is
		displayed, as defined by the editor.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/monitor.gif" align="middle">
	<p>You can add a watch marker to every field of the dialog from the
		context menu of the item. A watched icon is decorated like this:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/monitor_watched_item.gif" align="middle">
	<p>When the view is refreshed and the value of the data has
		changed, the field is highlighted with a yellow background:
	<p>

	<p>Cool, isn't it?
	<p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="info">Hint: You can change the background color from
				the <i>Colors and Fonts</i> page of the Eclipse preferences.

		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Invalid Data Warning</h2>
	<p>If the monitor encounters a problem when copying the data to the
		screen, it displays the following message at the bottom, right corner
		of the view:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/invalid_data_warning.gif" align="middle">
	<p>If get this message, make sure that the fields of your editor
		are properly defined, with the correct offset, type and length.
	<p>
	<h2>Invalid Data Error</h2>
	<p>If the monitor encounters a serious problem when copying the
		data to the screen, it displays the following message at the bottom,
		right corner of the view:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/invalid_data_error.gif" align="middle">
	<p>If get this message, make sure that the fields of your editor
		are properly defined, with the correct offset, type and length.
