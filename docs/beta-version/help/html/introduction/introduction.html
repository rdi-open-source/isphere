The iSphere Open Source Project delivers high quality extensions for WDSC, RDP and RDi to further 
improve developer productivity.
<p>
IBM's current Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a huge step beyond SEU, but 
it still lacks features available only on the green screen. That is where the iSphere Project comes 
into play, filling in those gaps.
<p>
iSphere features are driven from our ideas and needs, but everybody is encouraged to contribute 
suggestions and manpower to improve the power of iSphere.

The iSphere project team.
