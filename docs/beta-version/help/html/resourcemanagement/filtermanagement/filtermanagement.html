	<h1>RSE Filter Management</h1>
	<p>With iSphere RSE Filter Management you can export some or all
		filters from your workspace to a repository. A repository is an XML
		file on your local PC or a network drive. You can then import some or
		all filters from a repository to your workspace. The repository can
		act as a backup for your filters.
	<p>Here are some other scenarios where you might find Filter
		Management useful:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your workspace is corrupted and you need to create a new one.
			In this case you can export your filters from the old workspace and
			import them into the new one.</li>
		<li>You want to share your filters with your colleagues.</li>
		<li>You have RDi installed on a computer in your office and at
			home and want to synchronize your filters.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To open the iSphere RSE Filter Management dialog, click on the <i>Sun</i>
		icon in the upper right corner of the Remote Systems view, or select <i>RSE
			Filter Management</i> from the <i>iSphere</i> menu.

	<h2>Choosing what to Manage</h2>
	<p>You now need to specify what you want to manage, and also the
		repository name:
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_choose.png"
			align="middle">
	<h3>Editing Area</h3>
	<p>The filters in the workspace and in the repository will be
		displayed in up to four separate horizontal panes.
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Edit workspace and repository filters</li>
		<li>Edit only workspace filters</li>
		<li>Edit only repository filters</li>
	</ul>

	Click the appropriate button. The default,
	<i>Edit workspace and repository filters</i>, is suitable for the first
	time you want to create a new repository. With this option you can:
	<ul>
	<li>Push filters from the workspace to the repository and vice versa.</li>
	<li>Delete filters from the workspace.</li>
	<li>Delete filters from the repository.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The next two option, <i>Edit only workspace filters</i> and 
	<i>Edit only repository filters</i> are suitable for removing filters from
	the workspace or the repository.
	<h3>Profile</h3>
	Select the profile that contains the filter pools you want to manage.
	<h3>Single Filter Pool</h3>
	If this is checked, then you will need to select a filter pool using
	the	<i>Filter Pool</i> drop down below. Only filters in this filter pool
	will be considered for action, and the filter pool name will not be
	saved. (Note that even if you never explicitly created a Filter Pool, a
	default filter pool is created for each connection and it is shown in
	the	<i>Filter Pool</i> drop down.)
	<P>If this is unchecked, then all filters will be considered for
		action and the connections between filters and filter pools will be
		saved.
	<h3>Filter Pool</h3>
	Use this option to specify the filter pool you want to manage, when 
	<i>Single filter pool</i> is checked.
	<h3>Repository</h3>
	Specify the location and name of the repository. A single filter pool
	repository must have a suffix of
	<b> .rseflt</b> and a repository for all filters must have a suffix of
	<b> .rsefltall</b>.
	<p>
	<h2 id="exporting_all_filters_for_the_first_time">Exporting All Filters for the First Time</h2>
	Suppose we have chosen to manage like this, exporting all filters for
	the first time to a new repository:
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_choose_all.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>When we click [OK] we get a screen like this:
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action01.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>Since this is an export to a new repository, there is only one
		pane, showing the filters in the workspace.
	<p>Click [Select all] and all the filters are selected. (Note that
		you can also select filters in the traditional way, by clicking on them
		and using the Shift and Ctrl keys.)
	<p>All the action buttons on the right are now activated:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action02.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>Click the [Push to Repository] button and the action column is
		populated for all selected flters:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action03.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>
	<p>Now click the [Perform action] button at the bottom left. You
		get a confirmation prompt :
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action04.png"
			align="middle">.
	<p>If you click [Yes] the repository is updated.
	<br>If you click [No] you get back to the editor.
	<br>If you click [Cancel] nothing is updated and the editor is closed.
	<p>
	<h2>The Editing Window Areas</h2>
	The filters in the workspace and in the repository are displayed in up to four 
	separate horizontal panes, with these titles:
	<ul>
	<li>Filters only in workspace</li>
	<li>Filters only in repository</li>
	<li>Filters in workspace and in repository with a different type or string</li>
	<li>Filters in workspace and in repository with an equal type and string</li>
	</ul>
	When you export filters for the first time only the first area, 
	<i>Filters only in workspace</i>, is displayed. The other areas are displayed
	depending on the selected options and the existence, and filter string values, of the filters in the
	workspace and the repository.
	<h2>Exporting All Filters After a Change</h2>
	Suppose we create a new filter,
	<i> LENNONS/XPR-O</i>, in the
	<i>Experimental_Stuff</i> filter pool. Then we decide to delete the
	<i>LENNONS2/XPR_2</i> filter. This will be our new filter setup going
	forward and we want to update our repository. We set up to manage as we
	did for the first export:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_choose_all.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>
	<p>Now when we click [OK] we see this:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action05.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>The 3 horizontal panes show the differences and the similarities
		between the workspace and the repository.
	<p>By selecting filters and setting the desired <i>Action</i> using the
		action buttons on the right, we can bring the workspace and repository
		into synch:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_manage_action06.png"
			align="middle">
	<p>
		This is a rather simple example and it might have been easier to just
		export all filters to a new repository, but you have flexibility in
		managing as you choose. Note the actions you can define in the <i>Action</i>
		column:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Push to workspace.</li>
		<li>Push to repository.</li>
		<li>Delete from workspace.</li>
		<li>Delete from repository.</li>
		<li>Delete from both.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<h2>Restoring Filters and Filter Pools</h2>
	With a
	<b>filter</b>, you can subset objects on the server. A filter is a set
	of definitions and a filter can be used in one or more
	<b>connections</b>, though it may return a different set of objects on
	different connections.
	<p>
		A <b>filter pool</b> is a group of filters. If you end up with many
		filters, you can group them into filters pools. A filter pool can also
		be used in one or more connections.
	<p>When you restore a filter or a filter pool it may be necessary
		to assign it to a connection.
	<p>Suppose we create a brand new workspace but have not yet created
		a connection, but we want to import our filters. By setting up to manage
		like this, we can import all our filters:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import01.png" align="middle">
	<p>If we go to the RSE view, we do not see any filters or filter
		pools:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import02.png" align="middle">
	<p>However, if we switch to the Team view, we can see that the
		filters and filters pools are there.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import03.png" align="middle">
	<p>
		We create a connection in the RSE view and then use the <i>View</i>
		menu to <i>Show Filter Pools</i>:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import04.png" align="middle">
	<p>
		Now we can right click on <i>Objects</i> and click on <i>Select
			Filter Pools</i>:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import05.png" align="middle">
	<p>Then pick which filter pools will be assigned to this
		connection:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import06.png" align="middle">
	<p>
		Alternatively, you can also assign filters one at a time by creating a
		new <i>Filter Pool Reference</i>:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import07.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<h2>Restoring Filters (saved from a single filter pool)</h2>

	If you are importing a single filter pool, make sure you identify the
	target filter in the
	<i>Filter poo</i>l drop down:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import08.png" align="middle">
	<p>Filters you chose to be restored will end up in this filter
		pool, even if they were saved from another filter pool:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/rse_filter_management_import09.png" align="middle">
