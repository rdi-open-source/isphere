  The iSphere search feature relies on the IBM regular expression functions and uses
  regcomp() for compiling regular expressions.
  This function follows more of a Posix/Unix specification, as stated by IBM support. Therefore
  some commonly used character classes to not work, for example <i>\s</i> for white spaces.
  <p>
  For example, comonly used expression when searching for <i>white spaces</i> are:
  <pre class="codeIndent">
  dcl-f +filea
  dcl-f\s+filea
  dcl-f[ ]+filea
  dcl-f[\s]+filea
  </pre>
  Let as assume we had the following input data:
  <pre class="codeIndent">
  dcl-f filea;
  dcl-f  filea;
  dcl-f   filea;
  dcl-f   fileb;
  </pre>
  In that case we would get three matches, namely for the first three lines. The
  fourth line does not match the expression, because of the <i>'fileb'</i> literal.
  <p>
  Not so the regcomp() function. It does not understand the <i>\s</i> character class
  for white spaces and hence searches for a back-slash (\) followed by letter 'a'.
  <p>
  Instead of using <i>\s</i>, you have to pass <i>[:space:]</i> to regcomp() to search for
  white spaces. But that only works when used in a character set. So you have to enclose
  <i>[:space:]</i> into [], which makes it look like this:
  <pre class="codeIndent">
  dcl-f[[:space:]]+filea
  </pre>
  It is not very surprising, that other languages does not support Posix expressions,
  such as <i>[:space:]</i>.
  <p>
  Please refer to the following documents to learn more about Posix regular expressions. The
  first link was provided by IBM support. Thank you IBM support.

  <p>
  Due to the lack of a complete description of <i>regcom()</i>, it is up to you to figure
  out what Posix expressions work with <i>regcom()</i> and which expressions are not
  supported.
