Applet README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version of the emulator includes an applet version of the emulator to be
embedded in a webbrowser.

Big thanks goes to Bob Fludder at http://www.businessvision.au for testing and
helping with this.  He is suppose to write a how to and/or deployment for the
applet version of the emulator.

Help is needed here with information and or changes to the code to allow a
seemless integration.  There are probably bugs in there so please be nice when
reporting them ;-)

Browsers Tested
---------------
Netscape

Plugins Tested
--------------
1.3.1
1.4 beta 3

One thing about the 1.4 beta 3 plugin is that it allows a signed jar to be
loaded and the proper authority is prompted for the certificate.  Once accepted
the certificate is then saved thus saving the deployment, installation and
importing of keys/signatures to each of the desktops.  Very Very nice.

Deployment
-----------
There are to applet html files that are included:

My5250App.html
My5250AppPlugin.html


I am going to have to refer you to the experts at the discussion forum of sun
at the following:

http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=63&thread=174214

This has the best information on signing and deploying applets.  This being my
first applet program I am at a lost for help on deployment for the different
browsers and I do not have the time to test them all.
