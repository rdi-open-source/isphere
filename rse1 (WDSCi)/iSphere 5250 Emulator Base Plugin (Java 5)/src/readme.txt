tn5250j README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an implementation of the 5250 telnet protocol in java.  I started it
because I could not find a 5250 emulator of Linux with the enhanced functions
like graphical windows, cursor progression, continued edit fields, masked edit
fields etc.....

Changes to last release since forever and a day
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****  JDK Version WARNING *****
I am only going to release versions compiled with JDK 1.4 if you need a 1.3
version please download the sources and compile it or from CVS.  This will be
the last release that fully supports JDK 1.3.  If you have problems with this
please express them on the tn5250j-general mailing list or e-mail privately.
We need to get ready for the new JDK's and will only support the latest two
available jdk releases.
*******************************

I truthfully can not remember all that has happened since the last release
so will only list here some of what I remember and the most important.

First and foremost lots of bug fixes and enhancments.
Second the whole code base has been refactored to run in headless mode:
   1) You do not need to have the gui to have access to the data stream
      Can you say screen scraping?  Well hopefully it all works.   
   2) A ProtocolBean has been added for this.
   3) A SessionBean has been added for this.
   4) The code now uses events for all this information so you can write your
      own listeners to these events. There are some people that have used this for 
      such work so ask on the mailing list and am sure some samples can be
      given or at least help with it.  The events are in org.tn5250j.event

Logging modules have been added for log4j or built in console support.  You
can reference this on the Connection panel under the Logging Panel

New session properties have been added.  Take a look at the options for more
on this.

Anything else please ask on the mailing lists.  Hope you enjoy.
