Ant build README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only tested this with ant build 1.4.1 so do not know if it is backwards
compatible with previous versions.

A lot of new options and targets have been added by Christian Geisert.  This
really makes the build process more flexible and complete.  Great thanks!!!!
For a list of these see step 7. below.

The new .jar file will be in the dist directly and named tn5250j and notmy5250j.

Steps to get started after setting up ant
-----------------------------------------
1. Create a base directory to place source
2. Create two directories beneath the base directory called lib and src

for example your directory structure should look like the following:

base directory
   |
   + - lib
   |
   + - src

3. Unzip and place all source files from tn5250j source zip file that was
   downloaded into src directory.

!! As of the newest build.xml the manifest file is built for you automagically.

4. Place the included build.xml file into the base directory.
5. Place the extra .jar files used for mailing in the lib directory.
   *** NOTE *** this is very important or some modules will not compile

   You can download the e-mail api's from sun.
   You will need two packages.
      http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/
      http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html

   JavaMail jar files
   ------------------
   activation.jar
   mail.jar
   mailapi.jar
   smtp.jar

   Scripting jar files
   ------------------
   jython.jar
   
   The jython.jar file is part of cvs or you can install the whole packes from
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/jython.  Go ahead and download it so you
   will have the interactive shell to play and test with the jython code
   base.

6. Now execute ant using one of the methods described in the ant documentation.

   using the sample bat file for windows below:

   c:\basedirectory>build all

   Sample Windows build.bat that I use on windows
   ----------------------------------------------
@echo off

rem this batch-file can be used to override the java_home or ant_home
rem environment or to set a special classpath and so on...
set ANT_HOME=D:\jakarta-ant-1.4.1
set JAVA_HOME=C:\jdk1.3.1
call %ANT_HOME%\bin\ant -buildfile build.xml %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

   ----------------------------------------------

For more information on the command line parameters that the build process
supports execute the following:

>ant -projecthelp

7. Main targets:

   all               Clean, Compile, Jar
   clean             Cleanup your workspace (delete build-directory, ...)
   compile           Compile your source-files
   dist              Creates all distribution archives
   dist-bin          Create a Zip and TGZ Archives with all the binary files
   dist-bin-prepare  Prepares binary distribution
   dist-bin-tgz      Create a Tgz-File with all the binary files
   dist-bin-zip      Create a Zip-File with all the binary files
   dist-src          Create a Zip and TGZ Archives with all source files
   dist-src-prepare  Prepares source distribution
   dist-src-tgz      Create a Tgz-File with all the source files
   dist-src-zip      Create a Zip-File with all the source files
   info              Prints a short summary of this project
   javadoc           Creates the javadoc API documentation
   package           Create a Jar-File of your compiled classes
