Setting up e-mail support
-------------------------

1. Download the e-mail api's from sun.  You will need two packages.

   http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/
   http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html

2. Unzip the files into there respective directories.  I use the same directory
   names as provided within the zip files.

Deployment
-----------

1. Copy the file activation.jar from the /jaf-1.0.1 file to the SAME DIRECTORY as
   the my5250.jar.

2. Copy the files
      mail.jar
      mailapi.jar
      smtp.jar

   to the SAME DIRECTORY as the my5250.jar.

If you list the directory where the my5250.jar file is you should see 4 files
with the extension .jar.  If this is not true then go to step one of Deployment
and start again.

3.  Now when selecting any e-mail functions you will have to configure the
properties first.  There will be a button to configure this before sending
e-mails.

Deployment with JavaWebStart
----------------------------
Using the webstart application the clients are automatically set up for use any
any changes are automatically downloaded and ready for use.

I also have scripts and or .bat set up to do the signing and copying to the
intranet.

I have included my sample .jnlp file that I use for deploying in JavaWebStart.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
